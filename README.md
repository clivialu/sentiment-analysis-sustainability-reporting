## In plain language

This research uses sentiment analysis to analyze the tone of firms’ sustainability reports.  
We examine whether the tone of corporate communication (positive, neutral, or negative) can predict how well firms perform environmentally in the following years.  
The results show that firms expressing a more positive and forward-looking tone in their sustainability reports tend to demonstrate stronger future environmental performance.  
These findings highlight the potential of linguistic analytics to provide early indicators of corporate environmental behavior.
