## In Plain Language

This research uses sentiment analysis to analyze the tone of firms’ sustainability reports.  
We examine whether the tone of corporate communication (positive, neutral, or negative) can predict how well firms perform environmentally in the following years.  
The results show that firms expressing a more positive and forward-looking tone in their sustainability reports tend to demonstrate stronger future environmental performance.  
These findings highlight the potential of linguistic analytics to provide early indicators of corporate environmental behavior.

## Paper Highlight:

| # | Why it matters | What the paper delivers |
|---|---------------|-------------------------|
| **1** | **Tone ≠ fluff.** Investors and regulators increasingly scrutinise the wording of sustainability reports, but whether language predicts actual environmental results was unknown. | Shows a negative association between optimistic tone and next-year environmental performance: firms using rosier language tend to pollute more, while cautious wording signals future improvement. |
| **2** | **Cracks the causality problem.** Prior studies risked reverse-causality bias (good performance → upbeat tone). | Implements a three-stage least-squares (3SLS) simultaneous-equations model to reveal a bidirectional dynamic: tone affects future performance and vice versa. |
| **3** | **High-stakes industry focus.** Extractive companies face the toughest scrutiny for greenwashing. | Analyses 76 U.S. mining, quarrying, and oil-and-gas firm-years (2010-2018) the sector where impression-management costs are highest. |
| **4** | **Peers matter.** Stakeholders benchmark language across competitors. | Introduces vertical (cross-firm) tone comparisons moving beyond year-to-year “horizontal” trends to show how outlier tone flags legitimacy tactics. |
| **5** | **Impression-management smoking gun.** Managers may mask poor eco-records with rosy wording. | Finds low performers systematically “talk positive” to maintain legitimacy, whereas high performers adopt a more sober, risk-averse tone. |

## Managerial Takeaways

- **Beware the feel-good façade.** Overly upbeat sustainability prose can be a leading indicator of future environmental under-performance; investors and lenders should run sentiment checks alongside hard KPIs.
- **Let results set the tone.** Firms with strong eco-metrics should avoid excessive optimism to reduce litigation risk and bolster credibility.
- **Strengthen governance gatekeepers.** Robust boards can curb “green gloss” by ensuring tone aligns with real performance improvements.
- **Use sentiment analytics as early warning.** Integrate tone dashboards into ESG monitoring to spot impression-management before reputational damage hits.
- **Policy nudge.** Findings support regulators considering mandatory, assured sustainability reporting to curtail opportunistic tone inflation.
